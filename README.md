This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to getting the offsetHeight of an HTML element immediately after setting its display style to "none".  The bug arises because the browser might not have fully updated the layout before the offsetHeight property is accessed, resulting in an unexpected value (often 0). The solution involves using a timeout or a requestAnimationFrame callback to ensure the layout updates before accessing the element's offsetHeight.
